## Setting a GRUB Bootloader Password

By creating an encrypted password using `grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2` we are able to add it to the custom configuration file.
We now are able to hit `e` at the GUB menu to access the GRUB2 line entry. The following image shows
the prompt asking us for our encrypted password.
